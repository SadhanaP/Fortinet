Question: When the project is using Spring 4.3  and Hibernate 5.2, how to write the JUnit test without 
bounded with concrete DB closely. In other words, How to mock DB in JUnit test for service method. 
If not possible give the reason else list cases for the different scenario.

Ans: If we follow Principles of Object Oriented Programming, and use the Spring Framework for Dependency Injection then
we can using mocking for unit testing. We can use Mocinto, a mocking framework for this purpose.
Eg: If we have a InventoryService.java class which need to test and assume this class dependency on another class Inventory.java
whose implementations we are not aware of. In this case we can just mock Inventory.class and test if our InventorySerrvice.java is working 
as expected or not

	@Before
    public void setupMock() {
        inventory = mock(Inventory.class);
       
    }
    @Test
    public void testMockCreation(){
        assertNotNull(product);
       
    }
